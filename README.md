# The Dice Is Right
 Welcome to The Dice Is Right! You will take turns rolling the dice. Every time you roll, the number you roll will add to that players scoreboard. The first player to get to 21 kills one of their oponents men! You have 3 lives, so roll wisely!

## Seeing the process out
I started thinking my game out from start to finish without touching a key. Once I had the idea in my head, I wanted to make it come to life! I wanted to use Canvas, but I also wanted to make sure I grasped what I've already learned before moving on to a new skill set. I am beyond excited to learn and implament it in the future though! 
Once I got to putting my ideas on the cumputer, I started with my wireframe and and laying out how I want to page to look and how I want to place all my information.

## MVP Goals
First, I will need to start with the layout of my game. I need to put something on the computer to work off of. I started with the board because it was easier for me to think out what and how I wanted it to look like, and from there I could visually see everything I was going to need to create in html and give it some more life with CSS and Javascript. I will need to make sure my HTML, CSS, and Javascript are linked together before moving too far.

-I will create the name of the game and my players
-I will need to get the bones of my game writen down.. There will be score areas for each player, player names, current scoreboards, and all of my buttons written out in my HTML and then I will use CSS to help me style my game
-Once I have a basic outline of my game on the screen, I can start writing some Javascript and turning it into a game!
-I would connect my HTML to my Javascript by using DOM Manipulation and in the end I would deploy it online using something like Heroku or Amazon Web Services.
-Turns will switch when each player has played their round and winner will be decided once someone reaches 21 and the loser loses all of their lives.
-I will set the current score and lives material
-I will set an array of images to roll through different sides of the dice
-I will set the buttons up to respond with "starting new game" "roll dice" and "hold
-I will determine winners and losers based on rolls and score

# Stretch Goals
-I LOVE styling, my biggest goal after finishing the project requirements and messing around with CSS, Javascript and draw.io as much as I can to implament as much beauty into the game as possible
-I would also like to work on side projects such as displaying a message in the players "message bubble" telling players whos turn it is, and messages when players win or lose.
-If I have any extra time to keep ajusting things I would also like to work on smoothing the game out.

## Potential Road Blocks
I get way to invested into what I'm doing to the point that I will spend hours trying to fix something before I delete it and write something else. This has been my biggest problem with learning how to code. My goal is to work on taking breaks to let my brain rest, and not being afraid to delete code and get a new prespective!

### Prerequasites 
I will be using Javascript, CSS, HTML5, and draw.io for the body of the board. Because of this, all you will need is an up to date browser to run the game!

## The Process of The Dice Is Right!
The first thing I did was plan out what I invisioned the outcome to be. This started in my head, then slowly worked its way to the computer using wireframe to make the blueprints
