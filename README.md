## Seeing the process out
I started thinking my game out from start to finish without touching a key. Once I had the idea in my head, I wanted to make it come to life! I wanted to use Canvas, but I also wanted to make sure I grasped what I've already learned before moving on to a new skill set. I am beyond excited to learn and implament it in the future though! 
Once I got to putting my ideas on the cumputer, I started with my wireframe and and laying out how I want to page to look and how I want to place all my information.

### Prerequasites 
I will be using Javascript, CSS, and HTML5. Because of this, all you will need is an up to date browser to run the game!

## The Process of The Dice Is Right!
The first thing I did was plan out what I invisioned the outcome to be. This started in my head, then slowly worked its way to the computer using wireframe to make the blueprints
