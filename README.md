# The Dice Is Right
 Welcome to The Dice Is Right! You will take turns rolling the dice. Every time you roll, the number you roll will add to your scoreboard, you can choose to hold your scoreboard number and end your turn, or roll again. Be careful though! If your scoreboard gets above 21, you will bust and your score will go back to 0! The player that gets closest to 21 without busting will win that round. You have three lives, the winner will be declared by last man standing!

## Getting Started
---
I wanted to create a game that would give me the ability to better my Javascript skills! This game is based on the well known card game "21" but instead of cards we will be using dice!

---

### (MVP Goals)
---
* Make sure everything is running smoothly together and there are no bugs
* Game instructions are clear to user
* Keeping code neet and organized for easy read and understanding
* Make sure all responses work
* Make things simple but fun with javascript!

---

### (Stretch Goals)
---
* I love styling, my biggest goal after finishing the project requirements and messing around with CSS, Javascript and draw.io as much as I can to implament as much beauty into the game as possible
* Work on side projects such as displaying a message in the players "message bubble" telling players whos turn it is, and messages when players win or lose.
* Naming each "life" and sending a message to the player (for example) "you killed pepe!"
* When player loses a turn, one of his men will get crossed out with a red X.
* I may mess around and put in an input section for each player to type there name in and fill the "Player one" "Player two" text
* I would really like to get AI's involved as well

---

### (Potential Road Blocks)
---
* Getting way to invested into what I'm doing to the point that I will spend hours trying to fix something before I delete it and write something else.
* Organization skills

---

### (Prerequasites)
---
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript


## Wireframe
---
* Simple layout of what the game will look like!

## The Process of The Dice Is Right
---
(DAY ONE AND TWO)

The first thing I did was plan out what I invisioned the outcome to be. This started in my head, then slowly worked its way to the computer using wireframe to make the blueprints.

(DAY THREE AND FOUR)

Started by creating the layout of the board and buttons in css, then did some basic styling. I continued to get the styling more like how I wanted and then started on some basic dice rolling and player switch functionalities. When doing this, I ran into a bug that took me a few hours to resolve. When I would roll the dice, the current score for player 2 would say NaN. I then realized I accidentally had a syntax error and when fixed the problem was resolved. Over the next couple days I plan on continuing to work on functionality, like the hold button and the new game button. I also want the 3 lives to pop up and the messages that display the current user's turn.

(DAY FIVE)
