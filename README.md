# The Game of Fire and Ice
This is my very first coding project! I have had so much fun learning to code and wanted to make this project into something I love. Game of Thrones is one of my favorite game and also a big inspiration for this game. One of the main story lines Game of Thrones brings you through over the course of the show is Daenerys Targaryen trying to make her way back to Kings Landing, where she will take back her place on the throne as queen!

In this game, you will play as Drogon, Daenerys Targaryen's loyal dragon. You are responsable for getting her past the knight king and his army. Make sure not to touch them or you die! Run forward to Kings Landing while dodging your enemies and get Daenerys to that iron throne! You will be timed and your high score will be recorded.

I started with thinking my game out to the end without touching a key. Once I had the idea in my head, I wanted to make it come to life! I started writing down my wireframe and ideas of what I wanted the game to be like.


### Prerequisites
This game is made up of HTML5, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and CANVAS. Because this game is made using Canvas, the minimal requirements for the game include..
